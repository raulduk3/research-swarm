"""One-paper agent runs: creation, the tool harness and the event trace.

A run is one genome version reading one paper. Creating it fixes the prompt,
the genome copy, the limits and a cost estimate, and passes budget admission
before any model call. Executing it appends one immutable event per step:
the prompt, each model call with its receipt, each tool call (allowed or
refused), each passage read, each note, the submitted reading and how the
run ended. Every event is committed as it happens, so a run that stops
half-way keeps its trace and its cost, and the run page replays the events
in order. What the page says a run did comes from these events alone.
