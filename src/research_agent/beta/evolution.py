"""Evolution: a switch, a cadence, and a generative step with no fitness function.

Nothing here ranks agents. When an island has finished enough runs since its
last generation, a child is made for it by mating: a parent from the island
and a mate from another island are combined, then one thing is changed. A
model proposes the child from the whole swarm's state when a provider is
configured and the budget admits the call; otherwise a seeded rule does the
mating, so a cycle always produces something and a test can repeat it.

The parent turns: the island's agents take it in the order of who has waited
longest since last being a parent, the liked ones first among equals, and an
agent that has not yet completed a threshold's worth of runs waits until it
has been read. People shape the population two ways only: by archiving
agents (switching them off) and by letting go of papers. When an island is
over its cap, the evaluated agent with the fewest points that has had the
most runs, and is not a parent of the new child, is archived, so the old
turns over toward the new and a child keeps its place until it has been
evaluated.

A generation is one spec revision together with its record, so it appears
whole or not at all, and shows on the island page with each decision.
